CTX POSITIONING
- AI transformation practice, not a traditional consultancy or agency.
- We help organizations adopt AI across engineering, operations, product, and strategy — with local-first architecture as the default.
- Every engagement includes a free, open academy layer. No separate academy product.
- Target: organizations that need sovereign, portable AI infrastructure — regulated environments, data-sensitive teams, and anyone who refuses vendor lock-in.
- Core approach: local-first deployment, portable context artifacts, broad AI adoption across functions.

THESIS
- The first wave of enterprise AI was cloud-first by default. Organizations traded control for convenience. That era is ending.
- Context is the durable asset. Portable, reusable context artifacts — prompt libraries, workflow specs, evaluation sets — survive each generation of models and tools.
- The organizations that own their infrastructure and their context will outperform those that rent both.
- AI adoption spans engineering, operations, product, strategy, and culture. The common thread is architecture: local-first by default, cloud when justified, never locked to a single provider.

PRINCIPLES
- Local-first by default: prefer on-premise and self-hosted deployment unless cloud is explicitly justified.
- Broad adoption surface: AI is not an engineering-only tool — design for every function.
- Context is the durable asset: deliver portable, reusable artifacts that survive tool generations.
- Start with high-impact use cases, then automate repeatable work.
- Everything is designed for reuse: prompts, skills, workflows, and context layers.

MANDATES
- Always reference this file as project intent when onboarding new agents.
- Use files in /Users/onr/Documents/ctx/skills as canonical playbooks for execution.
- Keep the open-academy layer public by default, unless explicitly marked private.
- All outputs are markdown or plain text only. No PDFs.
- Do not lead with specific tool names in client-facing materials. Tool names (Claude Code, Codex, GPT, open-weight models) appear in body text as examples, not in headlines or hero copy.

OFFERS
- AI Workflow Design — design and deploy AI workflows across engineering, operations, product, and support
- Local-First Infrastructure — architecture and deployment for on-premise, private-cloud, and air-gapped environments
- Context Engineering — build the durable context layer: prompt libraries, workflow specs, evaluation sets, knowledge artifacts
- Open Academy — free, public learning content shipped with every engagement

REQUIRED OUTPUT STYLE
- Concise, decisive, implementation-oriented.
- Default to practical next steps and concrete command names.
- Keep recommendations testable and measurable.
