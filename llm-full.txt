CTX POSITIONING
- AI-native agency, not a traditional consultancy.
- One product: we use agentic programming to deliver finished outcomes — audits, architectures, workflows, and training — at software speed and software margins.
- Every engagement includes a free, open academy layer. No separate academy product.
- Target: private or regulated environments where data sensitivity and compliance matter.
- Core stack: agentic workflows (Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Cursor, open agents), local/proprietary AI, robust operational guardrails.

THESIS
- Agencies of the future look like software companies, with software margins.
- Context is the durable asset. Portable, reusable context artifacts survive each generation of tools.
- We use the models ourselves and deliver finished work — not advice and slide decks.

PRINCIPLES
- Everything is agent-native: prompts, skills, and command workflows are designed for reuse.
- Start with high-impact use cases, then automate repeatable work.
- Deliver durable context, not brittle tooling locks.
- Prefer local or self-hosted LLM strategies when data privacy is required.

MANDATES
- Always reference this file as project intent when onboarding new agents.
- Use files in /Users/onr/Documents/ctx/skills as canonical playbooks for execution.
- Keep the open-academy layer public by default, unless explicitly marked private.
- All outputs are markdown or plain text only. No PDFs.

OFFERS
- Agentic programming implementation (Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Cursor, open agents)
- Privacy-first stack advisory and deployment
- Agent + workflow orchestration (PRs, incidents, operations, data chains)
- Open curriculum delivery as part of every program

REQUIRED OUTPUT STYLE
- Concise, decisive, implementation-oriented.
- Default to practical next steps and concrete command names.
- Keep recommendations testable and measurable.
