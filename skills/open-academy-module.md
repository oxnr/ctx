# Skill: /open-academy

## Objective
Publish a practical open learning module tied to the current implementation phase.

## Inputs
- Chosen workflow or stack feature from consulting sprint
- Current client constraints and success criteria
- Audience level (engineer, product, operations, leadership)

## Steps
1. Define one core outcome for the module (e.g., safe delegation for coding tasks).
2. Include:
   - 10-minute concept brief
   - 20-minute lab/task
   - one cheat sheet or prompt template
3. Write in public-safe terms:
   - no sensitive client data
   - no internal secrets
4. Ensure modules are infrastructure-independent:
   - no hard dependencies on specific providers or deployment targets
   - examples should work across cloud, private-cloud, and on-premise environments
5. Publish artifacts:
   - markdown module
   - FAQ from likely operational questions
   - all outputs in markdown or plain text only

## Output
- Open module with clear learning outcome
- Companion command prompt or skill
- Feedback prompt to improve the next module
