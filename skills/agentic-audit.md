# Skill: /agentic-audit

## Objective
Run a rapid intake and produce a unified diagnostic plan for agentic transformation.

## Inputs
- Company context and constraints from client brief
- Current stack list (editors, CI, ticketing, docs, data sources)
- Security/compliance requirements
- Team size and role distribution

## Steps
1. Capture current state:
   - What tasks are repetitive or error-prone?
   - Which systems have APIs or exportable logs?
   - Where does context break down between humans and tools?
2. Identify 6-12 high-signal use cases with impact and effort estimates.
3. Classify each use case:
   - safe for quick pilot
   - needs governance first
   - requires local/secure execution
4. Build a 30-day roadmap with:
   - 3 delivery milestones
   - 3 measurable outcomes
   - one open-academy module to publish during the sprint
   - artifacts only in markdown or plain text

## Output
- Audit doc with priorities: quick wins, strategic bets, blocked items
- Draft command names for the execution phase
- Recommended team responsibilities
