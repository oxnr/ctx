**[oxnr.github.io/ctx](https://oxnr.github.io/ctx/)**

## What is ctx?

ctx helps organizations adopt AI across engineering, operations, product, and strategy — with local-first architecture as the default. On-premise models. Portable context. No vendor lock.

## Tracks

- **AI Workflow Design** — design and deploy AI workflows across functions
- **Local-First Infrastructure** — on-premise, private-cloud, and air-gapped deployment
- **Context Engineering** — durable context layers that survive model generations
- **Open Academy** — free, public learning content shipped with every engagement

## Thesis

The organizations that own their infrastructure and their context will outperform those that rent both.
